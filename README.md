The text editor web application provides a seamless editing experience backed by a robust architecture and modern development tools. Upon opening the application in the editor, users encounter a well-organized folder structure accommodating both client and server components. Executing `npm run start` from the root directory effortlessly initiates the backend and serves the client, facilitating a smooth start-up experience. Leveraging webpack, JavaScript files are intelligently bundled, generating essential artifacts such as HTML files, service workers, and manifest files to optimize performance and enhance user interaction.

Users benefit from next-gen JavaScript capabilities, ensuring the text editor functions flawlessly in the browser without errors. Integrated IndexedDB swiftly creates database storage upon opening the editor, enabling seamless content saving and retrieval. Upon reopening the text editor, users discover their content persistently retrieved from IndexedDB, ensuring continuity and convenience. Additionally, users can conveniently download the web application as an icon on their desktops with a single click of the "Install" button. Moreover, the application incorporates a registered service worker using Workbox, pre-caching static assets upon loading, guaranteeing swift access to subsequent pages and resources. Upon deployment to Render, the application includes proper build scripts for webpack, ensuring a streamlined deployment process and delivering a reliable editing platform for users.
